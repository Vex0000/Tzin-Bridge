**Story**
A businessman is on a ship headed towards a city when a thunderstorm strikes the ship. The character wakes up on an island with only the clothes on their back and a lone ship's cargo chest containing a multitool. This multitool is used to chop trees, mine stone, or can be used as a weapon. The island is near the cursed continent of Tzin, which brings terrors to the island, and the player must defeat the cursed magical enemies. Each enemy slain contributes to a magical bridge and fills the player with more energy. After unbeknownst conditions are met, the businessman transforms into a magical being. 
As the bridge draws closer to the city, the player will discover that they were only building a bridge towards another island, and the cycle repeats from there. After the second bridge is formed, the player can accept their place in Tzin (true ending) or continue the cycle.
