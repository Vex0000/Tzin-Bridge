**Overview**
Tzin Bridge is a 3D turn-based survival RPG where you control a character stranded on a small island. 


**Story**
A businessman is on a ship headed towards a city when a thunderstorm strikes the ship. The character wakes up on an island with only the clothes on their back and a lone ship's cargo chest containing a multitool. This multitool is used to chop trees, mine stone, or can be used as a weapon. The island is near the cursed continent of Tzin, which brings terrors to the island, and the player must defeat the cursed magical enemies. Each enemy slain contributes to a magical bridge and fills the player with more energy. After unbeknownst conditions are met, the businessman transforms into a magical being. 
As the bridge draws closer to the city, the player will discover that they were only building a bridge towards another island, and the cycle repeats from there. After the second bridge is formed, the player can accept their place in Tzin (true ending) or continue the cycle.

**Core Gameplay**
•	Turn-Based (like Pokémon Mystery Dungeon)
  o	Moving does not take any turns (outside of combat)
  o	Every action you take is one turn
•	HP, Food, Temperature, Sleep, and Sanity bars need maintenance 
•	Constant transformations
•	Player is shipwrecked and stranded on an island; it needs to get back to the Capital City
  o	Build a bridge back to the city by claiming resources from the island and defeating enemies that land on the island. You can’t build a raft/boat because the currents are too strong.
